Table list and notes:
1. Kholat-Win64-Shipping.CT - Kholat (2015) Infinite stamina table, credits goes to original auto assemble script here 
https://guidedhacking.com/resources/kholat-cheat-table.200/. The actual table was behind a paywall, so used the script and saved it to a table.
Works on the latest Steam version of the game.
