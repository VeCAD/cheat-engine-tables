Table list and game notes:
1. Kholat-Win64-Shipping.CT - Kholat (2015, Steam v1.03) Infinite stamina table, credits goes to original auto assemble script here 
https://guidedhacking.com/resources/kholat-cheat-table.200/. The actual table was behind a paywall, so used the script and saved it to a table.
Works on the latest Steam version of the game. 
2. RobinHood.CT - Robin Hood Legend Of Sherwood (2002, GOG v1.1) Money hack to avoid using the ingame cheat code. Tested on GOG versoin, use with caution, the game can hit 'brick' state even without hacks. Refer more here: https://www.gog.com/forum/robin_hood_legend_of_sherwood#1645970124
